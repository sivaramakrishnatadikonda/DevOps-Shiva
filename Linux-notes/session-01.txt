What is DevOps?

SDLC
Waterfall vs Agile vs DevOps vs DevSecOps vs AiOps

SDLC
-------
Requirements analysis
Planning
Design --> General requirements to technical requirements
Implementation
Deployment
Testing
Maintaince

SMS --> School management system
Examination system

Stakeholders
=============
Parents
Students
Teachers

50 years back

Gurukuls --> waterfall(legacy model)
------------
year end exam
pass percentage --> 40%

DAY-1
Students --> Not serious
Teachers --> Not serious
Parents --> Yes

More exams --> process change

UNIT-TEST - I, II, III, Quarterly, IV, Half yearly, grand test

DAY-30
=======
students --> No
teachers --> serious
parents --> serious

pass/fail

25, 30, 35, 50, 70

90%

slip test --> daily test
========================
99%

students --> serious
teachers --> serious
parents --> serious

clients
developers
testers
operations
end users

waterfall
===========
once requirements are fixed we can't change
2 years project to go for PROD

last 1 year
last 1 month deploy --> 100 defects
20 invalid defects --> 

process change --> Agile

item --> 1 test --> 2 defects
1000 test --> 3 defects

Agile
===========
Final product --> multiple modules --> sprints

login and signup --> sprint-1 --> 30 days
orders
menu
payment
shipping
cart
reviews
employees

sprint-1
----------
clients UAT(user acceptance testing)

daily standups --> 

95% --> 5 defects, 1 invalid defect

sprint-2 --> orders + 4 defects

15 days 15 days testing and deployment

Process change --> Agile with DevOps
=========================

Signup and Login
==================

DAY-1 --> enter first name, enter last name, enter DOB

deploy on the same day, test on the same day
10 defects --> 1 invalid defect

DevOps is the process of building, deploying and testing the code written by developer on the same day instead of doing after complete development.. we can acheive this using continous integration, continous deployment, continous delivery and continous testing. 
We can do faster releases with less defect using DevOps... basically automation mindset to get the best results

DEV, QA, SIT, UAT, PERF, PRE-PROD, PROD

min 2, max any number

Linux --> Linus torvalds
=================
UNIX --> Hardware and Software(Unix OS) together
CPU, RAM, Hard Disk, OS(Software)
Laptop --> IBM BIOS

Linux --> from the sratch using C language based on unix principles. He invented git to store this

windows
-----------
not open source
costly
not secure must install anti virus
slow
too many graphics
frequent restarts
tough to update/upgrade

Linux --> 9MB
Secure
high speed --> mostly text
no need of restarts
install or update packages is easy
free, community support
low resources

AWS Accounts
================
Debit/Credit cards
